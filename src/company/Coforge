Key Areas to Focus On:
Core Java Concepts:

OOP principles: inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation.
Collections framework (List, Set, Map, Queue).
Exception handling and multi-threading.
String manipulation, file I/O, and Java 8 features like Lambda expressions and Streams.
Automation with Selenium:

Selenium WebDriver architecture and locators (XPath, CSS selectors).
Handling dynamic elements, waits (implicit/explicit), and browser automation.
Writing reusable code for test automation using Selenium.
API Testing with Rest Assured:

Understanding of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Validating responses using JSON/XML parsers.
Writing automation scripts to test REST APIs using Rest Assured.
Testing Frameworks:

Knowledge of JUnit/TestNG for unit and integration tests.
Implementing BDD with Cucumber and writing feature files.
How to integrate test frameworks with build tools like Maven/Gradle.
Git and Continuous Integration:

Basic commands in Git (commit, push, pull, branch).
Experience with CI/CD tools (Jenkins, GitLab CI) and integrating automated tests into pipelines.
Problem-Solving:

Be ready to solve coding challenges (like sorting algorithms, string manipulation, or finding patterns in arrays).
Sample problem: Write a Java program to find the longest substring without repeating characters.
Example Interview Questions:
Java: "What are the differences between HashMap and Hashtable?"
Selenium: "How would you handle pop-up alerts in Selenium WebDriver?"
Rest Assured: "How do you validate the response status and content from a REST API?"
Frameworks: "What is the role of a Page Object Model (POM) in Selenium?"
Problem-Solving: "Write a Java program to reverse a string without using in-built functions."
