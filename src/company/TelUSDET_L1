Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.
if there is no common prefix, return an empty string

Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"


Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.
A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).


ace  ----subsequnece of

s1 =abcde
{a , b, c, d , c} -- i

s2="ace"  -- j

if(charAt(i) ==charAt(j)) return true

for(int i=0;i<s1.length();i++){
char ch1=s1.charAt(i);

	for(int j=0;j<s2.length();j++){
		if(ch1==s2.charAt(j) return true
 		else false
		}

}
